            Here's a bit more about me:
        </p>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="fam">
                <h3>My Family</h3>
                <p>I am 21 years old and live in Maryland. I have a dog named Gabby, two loving parents and a younger brother.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="hobbies">
                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>I always enjoy spending time with friends and family when I can. I love playing video games, I would call myself 
                    a bit of a collector/completionist when it comes to playing video games. My favorite games right now are
                    Fortnite and Dead by Daylight. I also really enjoy Dragon Ball Z, from playing games to reading the manga and of 
                    course watching the anime.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="ethic">
            <h3>My Work Ethic</h3>
            <p class="inside_ethic">I am someone who is definitely a planner. I typically write down in my agenda all the important, time sensitive things I
                need to get complete every week. I would also consider myself very proactive about my work. If there is ever a situation
                to where I am working on something, and I do not understand it or need more help I always ask who I can in order to
                do what I need to correctly.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am someone who also prefers working as a team. In any setting I am in it is always better to collaborate with others
                and improve not only myself but others too. I also like to build strong relationships in the workplace, not just with
                what is being worked on but truly getting to know and become closer with people I work with.
