            Here are some of the courses I have taken related to the Visual Art major:

                <h4>

                <p class="class_text">
                    Branding and Communication was a more business focused course that went into what makes up brands and the design
                    behind them in the economy. In this course I developed my own personal website using Wix, which a lot of artistic
                    design was involved.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="c_2">
                <h4>
                    FAAR-108
                </h4>
                <p class="class_text">
                    Two-Dimensional Design was an introductory course all about art techniques related to the creation of 2-D work.
                    In this course I learned skills in drawing and painting as we had many projects that allowed us to explore our own
                    creativity with the required medium.

                <p class="class_text">
                    Mixed Media was a very fun class and allowed me to express my creativity in many ways using a wide
                    variety of materials. We had projects such as creating a book, making artwork out of paper, making artwork out
                    of cloth, and doing earthworks.

                <p class="class_text">
                    Graphic Design I was an exciting course that allowed me to combine some of my computer science skills and art skills
                    into creating visuals on the computer. In this class we used Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign to create
                    various projects such as how-to-guides, event posters, and small booklets.

                    Modernity in Visual Art is a course focused on the evolution of art throughout history to today. I learned a lot
                    about various art movements as well as the impact historic events had on art and how art changed through the years.
