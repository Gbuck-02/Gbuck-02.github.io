                <p class="class_text">
                    Introduction to Computer Science I is all about the foundations of coding. This course was taught with Python, and
                    I gained skills in object-oriented programming.

                    Web Design was a very introductory class structured to teach the basics about designing web pages. This course
                    taught a little bit of HTML and CSS and went into detail about styling and layouts for webpages.
                </p>

                <p class="class_text">
                    Introduction to Computer Science II is about further expanding upon the basics of coding. This course was taught 
                    with Java, and I also improved my skills in object oriented programming.

                <p class="class_text">
                    Data Structures and Algorithms went deeper into the concepts from CMSCI 125 and focused mainly on different types of
                    structural data in coding. This course was taught with Java and also included some object-oriented programming.

                <p class="class_text">
                    Computer Architecture was all about the behind the scenes work that goes on within computers. I learned a lot about
                    topics like binary, the processes behind data storage in the computer, and how circuits function in the computer.

                    Network Systems and Design went into what goes on over the network in computers. I learned a lot about various network
                    protocols and how they all worked to get information from one place to another in the network. In this course I also
                    did some coding projects using Python and Java that simulated what a TCP and UDP connection would look like for
                    something like a hangman game.

                    Principles of Software Development took a deep dive into what the full stack web development process is like.
                    I learned a lot about processes such as creating a web site on the front and back ends,
                    managing the data involved with the websites, and the version control that goes into the development as well as
                    security of a website. Through this class I gained/improved my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and
                    using GitHub.

                    Database Management Systems was all about back-end data manipulation. This course used various types of databases
                    such as SQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4j. Through this course I gained a lot of coding skills in the various types
                    of databases as well as improving my skills in HTML, PHP, and Python.

                    In Introduction to Data Science, I learned a lot about data and the types of things you can do/learn from it.
                    This course used R as a coding language to break down data and heavily identify different aspects of it.
